Some important notes:

This code will not work if the program is not contained in the same folder as the files "pokemon_data.csv"

There are a lot of data that is printed here but rest assured Jupyter does not print the ENTIRE data frame,
rather it simply puts a "..." in the middle of the first 5 and last 5 horizontal columns. This does not only 
save time scrolling but also ensures better readability of the file.
