Some important notes:

This code will not work if the program is not contained in the same folder as the files "pokemon_data.csv".

There are a lot of data that is printed here but rest assured Jupyter does not print the ENTIRE data frame,
rather it simply puts a "..." in the middle of the first 5 and last 5 horizontal columns. This does not only 
save time scrolling but also ensures better readability of the file. 

The files needed to code/modify the code yourself are also on the GitHub and are listed in the links above.

This program is writen in chronological order meaning that it will be hard, and sometimes impossible, to
start with the code that is situated at the bottom of the Notebook.
